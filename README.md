Calculator web app for every day use.

##Intentions
I've really enjoyed building this project because it is a great JavaScript challenge! I plan to continue adding features to this application and begin using it as an everyday calculator option specially designed for me!
Here are some features I look to add in the future
- Add parentheses to correctly perform order of operations. This will require programming recognition of the parentesis and completing those calculations first
- Clear the display upon typing new numbers in following execution of equals() function.
- Add a history field to output previous 5 calculations below the calculator.

##Pull-Requests
If you have any features that you think would be cool to implement in the calculator, feel free to make a pull request and share your ideas!
