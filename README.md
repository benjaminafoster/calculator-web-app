Calculator web app for every day use.

<h2>Intentions:</h2>
<p>I've really enjoyed building this project because it is a great JavaScript challenge! I plan to continue adding features to this application and begin using it as an everyday calculator option specially designed for me!</p>
<p>Here are some features I look to add in the future:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add parentheses to correctly perform order of operations. This will require programming recognition of the parentesis and completing those calculations first</li>
  <li>Clear the display upon typing new numbers in following execution of equals() function.</li>
  <li>Add a history field to output previous 5 calculations below the calculator. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Pull-Requests:</h2>
<p>If you have any features that you think would be cool to implement in the calculator, feel free to make a pull request and share your ideas!</p>
